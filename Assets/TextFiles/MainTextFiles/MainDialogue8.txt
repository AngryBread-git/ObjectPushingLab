Sorry to ask a favor, but a friend of mine is working on something.
He called it <style="ItalicBlue">"Serpent Tennis"</style> and he asked if I could hold onto some gameplay-elements.
And I said "yes" despite my apartment being full.{PauseTyping,500} So I guess my point is...{PauseTyping,300} do you mind holding onto them for me?
Thanks. {AddUIElement,4}You mustn't hold them for long.{PauseTyping,400} He said he'll be done within a month.{AddHat}
