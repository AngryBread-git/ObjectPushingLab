So sorry to ask a favor… but a friend of mine is working on something.
He called it “Serpent Tennis” and he asked if I could hold onto some UI-elements.
And I said “yes” despite my apartment being full. So I guess my point is, do you mind holding onto them for me?
You mustn’t hold them for long. He said he’ll be done within a month.{AddHat}
