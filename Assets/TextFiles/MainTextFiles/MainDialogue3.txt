You got another hat?{PauseTyping,0.2} And it went on the boulder?
You must forgive me Sisyphus. This is my first time creating matter in quite some time.
You know how it is - it takes longer than you’d think, objects never end where you want them, the works.
I’ll try to figure out a solution to the hat problem but in the meantime just focus on something else.
Like your rank. A Diamond Rank boulder pusher, not everyone can brag about being one of those.
{AddHat}And I imagine that, any day now, you’re going to be promoted.
