Okay Sisyphus, here’s the thi{PauseTyping,0.3}ng{PauseTyping,0.3}, thing…{PauseTyping,0.3} What?
You got rid of the boulder? Wha- but- you- how?
But all the fun things I had planned! 
There was gonna be a garden. And you could grow fruits and vegetables!
Th-the boulder was gonna turn into a coffee cup. I would say “finally something with a clear affordance!”
And the Boulder Pass. With an endless series of hats and funbucks!
You could stay here and have fun for hours! Days! Weeks! Eternity!!!
