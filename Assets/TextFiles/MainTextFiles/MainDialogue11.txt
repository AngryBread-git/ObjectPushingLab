Here's the thing Sisyphus, we have a problem.{PauseTyping,500} I'm sure you noticed.
The boulder can no longer roll properly.{PauseTyping,300} <style="OrangeBold">The hats</style> are in the way.
It's over.{PauseTyping,300} The punishment no longer applies.{PauseTyping,300} You can leave.
But I had so many fun things planned!
There was gonna be a garden. And you could grow fruits and vegetables!
Th-the boulder was gonna turn into a coffee cup.<br>I would say <style="ItalicBlue">"finally something with a clear affordance!"</style>
And the Boulder Pass. With an endless series of <style="OrangeBold">hats</style> and funbucks!
There would’ve been entertainment for hours!{PauseTyping,300} Days!{PauseTyping,300} Weeks!{PauseTyping,300} Eternity!!!
Well{PauseTyping,300}, I suppose this is goodbye. 
Enjoy your future, I hope it's as fun as <style="BoldRed">you imagined it</style>.{AddUIElement,5}
