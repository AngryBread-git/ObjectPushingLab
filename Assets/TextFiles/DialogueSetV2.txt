info om Sisyphus. i.e. cursed for eternity by the gods.

“The struggle itself towards the heights is enough to fill a man’s heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy.” - Albert Camus, 1942.

One must not imagine Sisyphus happy. 
He faces the same struggle day in and day out, with no end in sight.
The only reason one could imagine him happy is if one did not understand the sheer size of eternity.

One must not imagine Sisyphus happy. There is no intrinsic joy in pushing a boulder up a hill.
He toils without reward. *beat. * But what if he got a reward?
Now presenting: hat, the only meaning to his existence. 
Show of the time you’ve spent rolling a boulder with this groundbreaking piece of headwear.

Get one now and we’ll throw in *beat. The Diamond rank form Lol shows up. * a rank. That’s right, you’re now a Diamond-rank boulder pusher! Feel the engagement. 

(another hat, this one for the boulder.)
Keep up that engaging grind!

Really, still only Diamond? But you’ve been pushing the boulder nonstop.

What’s the point in pushing the damn boulder if you don’t get a reward? I’ll go complain to the higher ups (Gods?). 
In the meantime, here’s another hat.

Good news, Sisyphus. The gods have heard my complaint and I’ve even received a response. 
It says: “Dear Mortal. Thank you for contacting Mt. Olympus.
Unfortunately we are very busy at the moment. We will get back to you at the earliest opportunity. - The Gods”
That’s underwhelming. *beat. * How’s the boulder pushing?
Not much fun I imagine. *beat. * Have another hat.

gets demoted to Platinum
What?! That can’t be right. 
Pointlessness of not even getting a fancy rank.
I will try to figure out a way to make this thing more fun for you.

Ok Sisyphus, after entire minutes of figuring out a new and exciting idea, I think I have it.
Introducing, roguelike deck-builder mechanics.
(throws up 3 cards. )
oh oh, get that one. the third one. Look, “3% lifesteal from yoga mats” that’s definitely a buildaround.
Imagine! All yoga mats will heal you whenever you attack with one. Now things are getting engaging. 
With such a great first pick, I don’t even have to imagine you happy. Because I know you are.
